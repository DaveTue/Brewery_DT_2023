My special thanks go to my mentor David Manrique Negrin for his contributions to the project. He was the main supplier of the apparatuses for the brewery as well as the chemistry models. In addition, David has offered insightful advice on the design of the experiments, and the writing of this thesis.

I also want express my gratitude to my supervisor Loek Cleophas. He has monitored my progress and patiently reminded me to focus on the big picture throughout.

Finally, I am immensely grateful for my friends and family who have been an unfailing source of encouragement and reassurance.
